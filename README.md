# <Password-generator>
## Description
This is a secure password generator to output a secure password after certain parameters are selected. HTML and CSS was supplied along with some JavaScript to interact with the webpage.

This project was done in JavaScript. The main tools used were if statements, for statements, and the Math.floor and Math.random operators.

I learned about finding problems in the code both from errors and from unexpected outputs.
